## 🎯 Key Questions Answered

### Q1: Why do we need DynamoDB?
**A:** Lambda is stateless - it forgets everything after each request. DynamoDB provides "memory" to remember conversation context across multiple API calls.

**Without DynamoDB:**
```
User: "John Smith"
Bot: "What's your name?" ❌ Forgot you answered!
```

**With DynamoDB:**
```
User: "John Smith" [Stored in DynamoDB]
Bot: "Thanks John! Card number?" ✅ Remembers!
```

### Q2: What's stored in DynamoDB?
**A:** Session state including:
- Conversation history (for AI context)
- Collected payment data (temporarily)
- Current step in flow (name/card/expiry/cvv/confirm)
- Status (collecting/confirming/completed/error)
- Timestamps and TTL

### Q3: Doesn't storing card data violate PCI?
**A:** No, because:
- ✅ Stored temporarily (1 hour max with TTL)
- ✅ Encrypted at rest
- ✅ Deleted after tokenization
- ✅ Auto-deleted if abandoned
- ✅ Never logged or displayed in full
- ✅ Only exists during active collection

### Q4: Why do we need the AI model then?
**A:** The AI model and payment processing are **separate responsibilities**:

**AI Model (Bedrock):**
- Guides conversation naturally
- Asks appropriate questions
- Handles general queries
- Provides polite, helpful responses
- **Never processes actual payment data**

**Lambda Code:**
- Extracts payment data from messages
- Validates card numbers (Luhn algorithm)
- Validates expiry dates
- Stores in DynamoDB
- Calls Stripe for tokenization

**Analogy:**
- AI = Restaurant waiter (guides you through menu)
- Lambda = Payment terminal (processes your card)
- Waiter never touches your card!

### Q5: Does AI see the card numbers?
**A:** Yes and No:

**Yes:** AI receives user messages that contain card numbers  
**No:** AI is instructed never to repeat or echo them back

**Code Protection:**
```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
Rules:
- Never repeat back card numbers, CVVs, or expiry dates
- Just acknowledge: "Got it! What's the expiry date?"
- Do not store or echo sensitive information
"""
```

**Lambda Protection:**
```python
# Extract happens in Lambda code (not AI)
extracted = extract_payment_info(user_message, current_step)
session['collectedData']['card'] = extracted  # Stored directly

# AI just guides conversation
bot_response = invoke_bedrock(conversation_history, user_message)
# Returns: "Perfect! Expiration date?"
```

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Layer 1: AI Instructions
- System prompt instructs AI never to repeat sensitive data
- AI only acknowledges and guides

### Layer 2: Code Extraction
- Lambda code extracts payment data using regex
- Validates immediately (Luhn, expiry, CVV)
- Stores in DynamoDB directly

### Layer 3: Temporary Storage
- DynamoDB with 1-hour TTL
- Encrypted at rest
- Deleted after successful tokenization

### Layer 4: Tokenization
- Stripe creates payment token
- Original data deleted from DynamoDB
- Only token returned to frontend

### Layer 5: No Logging
- Full card numbers never logged
- CloudWatch logs show masked data only
- Audit trail without sensitive info

## 📈 Session Lifecycle

### Stage 1: Creation
```json
{
  "sessionId": "abc-123",
  "conversationHistory": [],
  "collectedData": {},
  "currentStep": "none",
  "status": "collecting",
  "ttl": <1 hour from now>
}
```

### Stage 2: Collection
```json
{
  "sessionId": "abc-123",
  "conversationHistory": [
    {"role": "user", "text": "John Smith"},
    {"role": "assistant", "text": "Card number?"}
  ],
  "collectedData": {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "card": "4242424242424242"
  },
  "currentStep": "expiry",
  "status": "collecting",
  "ttl": <1 hour from now>
}
```

### Stage 3: Confirmation
```json
{
  "sessionId": "abc-123",
  "collectionData": {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "card": "4242424242424242",
    "expiry": "12/25",
    "cvv": "123"
  },
  "currentStep": "confirm",
  "status": "awaiting_confirmation",
  "ttl": <1 hour from now>
}
```

### Stage 4: Tokenization
```
1. Call Stripe API with collected data
2. Receive token: tok_abc123xyz
3. DELETE session from DynamoDB
4. Return token to frontend
```

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

### 1. Separation of Concerns
✅ AI = Conversation guide (polite waiter)  
✅ Lambda = Payment processor (card terminal)  
✅ DynamoDB = Temporary memory (receipt pad)  
✅ Stripe = Payment gateway (bank)

### 2. Temporary Storage
✅ Max 1 hour in DynamoDB  
✅ Deleted after tokenization  
✅ Auto-deleted if abandoned  
✅ Encrypted at rest

### 3. PCI Compliance
✅ No long-term card storage  
✅ Encrypted in transit and at rest  
✅ Masked display only  
✅ Tokenization before external use  
✅ No sensitive data in logs

### 4. Why Both AI and Storage?
✅ AI provides natural conversation  
✅ Lambda extracts and validates data  
✅ DynamoDB enables stateful multi-turn chat  
✅ Together they create seamless UX
